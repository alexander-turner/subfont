/**
 * Once per segment, at a moment chosen at random inside that segment, ask the
 * agent one of the {@link PROMPTS} questions about the work it is doing. Which
 * question it gets is drawn from the same hash as the moment, so a session meets
 * each of them over a run, and every hook process agrees with no shared state.
 *
 * Segments are measured from the session's OWN first event, not from the epoch,
 * so every session's first moment is ahead of it. An epoch-aligned grid
 * instead drops the first segment for every session that starts after its
 * moment, which is half of them.
 *
 * The check rides an event the agent is ALREADY running under — its own tool
 * call, or a prompt the user just sent — rather than a timer, so an idle session
 * is never woken: no event, no question. A segment whose moment passed while the
 * agent sat idle is carried to its next event, so a session that works in bursts
 * is asked at the same rate as one working straight through. Only the main
 * thread is asked. Advisory: every fault exits silently. Dependency-free on
 * purpose: the template ships no node_modules, so this runs on a bare `node`.

**Bullshit check.** Answer from artifacts, not from memory:

- Name the file or line that shows the work still matches the request.
- List any failure you got past without fixing — a skipped test, a waived check, a re-run over a red — and fix it or say why not.
Nothing to report? One sentence, then carry on.`,
  `<!-- periodic bullshit check -->
**Bullshit check — are you taking the principled solution?** The principled fix removes the cause; the other kind hides the symptom. Answer about the fix you are shipping, not the one you meant to ship:
- Name the root cause, and the line that shows this change removes it rather than the symptom you saw.
- Name what you took the shortcut on — a special case, a retry, a widened exception, a narrowed assertion, a number you guessed instead of deriving — and either take the principled fix now or say what forbids it.
- Name the search (a grep, a test run) that found the other sites that break the same way. Fix them, or say which ones you left and why.
Already principled? One sentence, then carry on.`,
  `<!-- periodic bullshit check -->
**Bullshit check — is any of this unnecessary?** Think from first principles about what the work is trying to achieve. Interrogate what you built before calling it done:
- Is anything here unnecessary, overly complicated, or based on a weak assumption? Challenge them.
- What can you delete entirely? Name it by file.
- What can you simplify now that the unnecessary pieces are gone?
Then make the changes. Prefer deleting over simplifying, simplifying over optimizing, and optimizing over automating. It might be done already: you do NOT have to change anything. If it is good, leave it alone.`,
