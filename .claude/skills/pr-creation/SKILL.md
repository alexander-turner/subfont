  Creates high-quality pull requests with an iterative compress-critique-fix loop before submission.
  Activate this skill whenever you are asked to create, open, submit, or push a pull request,
  OR whenever a new feature, fix, or refactor is complete and ready to ship.
  Also activate when the user says "make a PR", "open a PR", "submit this for review",
  "push and create a PR", "I'm done, create the PR", "the feature is done", "I'm finished",
  or any variation of completing work / requesting a pull request.
  Always activate before running `gh pr create`.

# Pull Request Creation Skill

**IMPORTANT: Always follow this skill before creating any PR.** Do not skip steps, especially the iterative compress-critique-fix loop.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user says any of the following (or similar):

- “Create a PR” / “Create a pull request”
- “Open a PR” / “Open a pull request”
- “Make a PR for this”
- “Submit this for review”
- “Push and create a PR”
- “I’m done, create the PR”
- “Can you PR this?”
- “Send this up for review”
- “The feature is done” / “I’m finished” / “Ship it”

Also activate when:

- You have just finished implementing a new feature, fix, or refactor—run the loop, then create the PR
- The user asks you to submit completed work
- CLAUDE.md or task instructions say to create a PR when done

Do **NOT** use this skill for:

- Reviewing an existing PR (use `gh pr view` or `gh pr diff` instead)
- Merging a PR (`gh pr merge`)
- Updating a PR description only (just run `gh pr edit`)

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be authenticated
- All changes must be committed to a feature branch (not `$CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF`/`master`)

## Updating an Existing PR

Before updating an existing PR (pushing new commits, editing the description, etc.), you MUST check its current status:

1. Run `gh pr view <pr-number> --json state` to check the PR state
2. Based on the result:
   - **Open**: Proceed with the update normally
   - **Merged**: Do NOT update it. Create a new PR instead with the additional changes
   - **Closed** (not merged): Ask the user what they’d like to do, if not already clarified

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. The base branch is in the env variable `$CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF`
2. Run `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Run `git log <base-branch>..HEAD --oneline` to see all commits
4. Review the changed files to understand the scope
5. **Check for PR description guidance**—look for `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, or similar files in the repo. If found, read them and adapt the PR description to follow the repository’s conventions (see [pr-templates.md](pr-templates.md) for details)
6. **Deferred-item sweep**—search plan/handoff docs and follow-up lists (TODO files, open sub-issues, notes in PR descriptions or linked issues) for items that touch this PR’s area:
   - Small, clearly-wanted items: fold them into this PR before opening it
   - Larger items: open follow-up PRs in the same session immediately after this one; note them in the PR description
   - Questionable items: surface in chat before proceeding
   - Update any plan/handoff doc’s status for items this PR completes or moots

### Step 2: Push and Create the Pull Request

You MUST read [pr-templates.md](pr-templates.md) for the PR template and formatting guidelines before this step.

1. Push the branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`
2. Check if a PR already exists for the current branch:

   ```bash
   EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json number --jq '.[0].number' 2>/dev/null)
   ```

   If a PR already exists, update it with `gh pr edit` instead of creating a new one.

3. Create the PR using `gh pr create` with the template from the resource file. Make sure that you use the target branch

**Write the body for the reviewer's cognitive budget, not as an investigation archive** —
see [pr-templates.md](pr-templates.md) "Body Guidelines" for the evidence and the rules. The
load-bearing ones: lead with _what_ the PR does (inverted pyramid — root-cause forensics go
below the fold, never above the statement of the change); make length proportional to the
reviewable diff (a ~10-line change is a few sentences, not a 500-word skeleton); omit empty
ritual sections instead of spending a paragraph to say "None"; and add a **Review focus**
line naming the file to read first, the cross-file invariant, and the part you're least sure
of — the single element most correlated with a human actually engaging, which matters because
agent-authored PRs are systematically _under_-reviewed. Use the exact headings from
pr-templates.md (`What & why` / `Review focus` / `How it was tested` / `Decisions made` /
`Lessons Learned`) so a reviewer can scan by habit.

### Step 3: Iterative Compress-Critique-Fix Loop

CI is already running; use this time to improve the code.

Run an iterative loop until you reach a fixed point—a full critique pass that turns up nothing worth changing. This is the same loop described in `CLAUDE.md`’s Self-Critique Loop section; apply it here on the full diff.

You MUST read `.claude/skills/pr-creation/critique-prompt.md` once before the first pass—it contains the detailed checklist the sub-agent needs.

Each pass:

1. Launch a critique sub-agent using the Task tool:
   - `subagent_type`: “general-purpose”
   - `description`: “Critique code changes”
   - `prompt`: Include the full diff (`git diff $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF...HEAD`) and the critique prompt from the resource file
   - `model`: `"opus"` — this is an adversarial review, per `CLAUDE.md` → Delegation's tiering. When the session model that wrote the diff was not Opus, add one line to the prompt: a weaker or cheaper model wrote the diff, so scrutinize it harder than a routine pass.
2. For each issue raised, assess validity, then take the easy wins first:
   - **Compress**—delete dead code, unused imports, commented-out blocks, WHAT-comments, backwards-compat shims, premature abstractions
   - **Readability**—tighter names, un-nest conditionals, combine related checks, guard-clause early returns
   - **Code reuse**—extract duplicated logic into helpers; search for existing utilities before adding new ones
   - **Parametrize tests**—collapse near-identical tests into a single parametrized/table-driven test with exact-equality assertions
   - **Fixtures**—pull repeated setup/teardown into shared fixtures
   - **Correctness**—bugs, edge cases, security, swallowed errors
3. Commit the fixes (Conventional Commits format, per `CLAUDE.md`)
4. Start a fresh critique pass—the previous output is now stale

**Stop** when a full pass returns no actionable issues. Cap at ~5 passes; if issues are still being found at pass 5, stop, summarize what’s left, and ask the user how to proceed rather than looping silently.

**Skip the loop** for trivial changes (typo fixes, single-line config tweaks, pure docs edits)—say so explicitly when you skip.

### Step 4: Run Validation

Run the project’s test/lint/typecheck commands (see [pr-templates.md](pr-templates.md) for common commands per language). Fix any failures before proceeding. If validation surfaces new defects, loop back into Step 3 with the fixes included.

### Step 5: Update PR Title and Description (after any post-creation changes)

Push any commits made during the critique and validation steps, then update the PR to reflect the final state. **Re-run the prior-art search over merged PRs touching your files first** — one that landed while yours was in review can already own your change, and the pre-branch search cannot see it.

1. Push: `git push`

2. Re-read the diff (`git diff $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF...HEAD`) and commit log (`git log $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF..HEAD --oneline`) to see the full scope
3. Rewrite the title and body to accurately describe the **current totality** of changes, not just the original scope:

   ```bash
   gh pr edit <pr-number> --title "<type>: <updated description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <updated body using template from pr-templates.md>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

Skip the description update if no commits were made after Step 2.

### Step 6: Wait for CI Checks (MANDATORY)

1. Run `gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch` to monitor
2. If any checks fail, investigate and fix the issues
3. Push fixes, update the PR description (Step 5), and wait again
4. Only proceed once all checks are green

### Step 7: Scrub AI Attribution from the Description

Re-read the current PR description (`gh pr view <pr-number> --json body --jq .body`) and remove anything related to “authored by Claude Code” or similar AI-tool attribution—`claude.ai` URLs, session links, “Generated with Claude Code” footers, co-author lines referencing Claude, etc. This mirrors the `CLAUDE.md` rule to never include such links in PRs, and catches any that slipped in via templates or earlier edits. If any are found, update the description with `gh pr edit` to remove them.

### Step 8: Report Result

Provide the PR URL and confirm all CI checks have passed.

### Step 9: Iteration Retrospective

After reporting the result, briefly reflect on how you could have iterated faster on this task. Consider:

- **Parallelization**: Which investigations, tool calls, or sub-agent launches could have run in parallel instead of sequentially?
- **Targeted checks over full sweeps**: Were there broad searches or full test runs you ran locally that CI would have caught anyway? Could a more targeted check (single file, single test, quick lint) have been faster?
- **Earlier CI delegation**: CI started at Step 2; did the critique loop or local validation catch issues CI would have caught anyway?
- **Critique loop efficiency**: Did any critique passes surface issues that a quick re-read would have caught before launching the sub-agent?

State each insight as one concrete line. Skip this step if the task was trivial (single-file, no iteration needed).

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Bug Fix

**User says:** “I’m done fixing the login bug, create a PR”

**Claude’s actions:**

1. Runs `git diff $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF...HEAD`—sees changes in `src/auth/login.ts` and `tests/auth/login.test.ts`
2. Runs `git log $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF..HEAD --oneline`—sees 2 commits
3. Pushes and creates PR: `gh pr create --title "fix: handle null session token in login flow" --body "..."`—CI starts immediately
4. Launches critique sub-agent with the diff
5. Critique returns: “Looks good, minor suggestion to add null check on line 42”
6. Fixes the null check, commits: `fix: add null check for empty session token`
7. Runs `pnpm check && pnpm test && pnpm lint`—all pass
8. Pushes fixes, updates PR description to reflect the null-check fix
9. Watches CI with `gh pr checks 47 --watch`—all green
10. Reports: “PR #47 created and all CI checks pass: <https://github.com/org/repo/pull/47>"

### Example 2: Multi-Commit Feature

**User says:** “Submit this for review”

**Claude’s actions:**

1. Runs `git diff $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF...HEAD`—sees changes across 8 files including new components, tests, and API routes
2. Runs `git log $CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF..HEAD --oneline`—sees 5 commits
3. Pushes and creates PR with a draft description—CI starts immediately
4. **Pass 1:** Critique flags 4 issues—unused import, two near-identical tests that should parametrize, duplicated validation logic across 2 components, an over-engineered single-caller wrapper. Fixes them: deletes the import, collapses the tests with `it.each`, extracts a shared `validateInput` helper for the duplication, inlines the single-caller wrapper. Commits.
5. **Pass 2:** Critique flags 2 more—a leftover WHAT-comment from the refactor and a nested conditional. Un-nests and removes the comment. Commits.
6. **Pass 3:** Critique returns clean—fixed point reached, exit loop.
7. Runs validation—all pass
8. Pushes fixes, updates PR title and description to reflect all changes
9. Watches CI—one check fails (lint warning on new file)
10. Fixes lint issue, pushes, updates PR description again—all green
11. Reports success with PR URL

### Example 3: Ambiguous Follow-up

**User says:** “Push this up”

**Claude’s actions:** Pushes the branch and opens a PR against `$CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF` by default — finishing work is the explicit ask per CLAUDE.md. Only pushes without opening a PR if the user said not to, or a PR for this branch already exists (then updates that PR instead).

## Error Handling

- **Critique finds issues**: Fix them before proceeding—do not skip
- **Tests fail**: Fix the tests, don’t skip them
- **`gh` not authenticated**: Tell user to run `gh auth login` or set `GH_TOKEN`
- **Push fails**: Check branch permissions and remote configuration
- **PR already exists (HTTP 422)**: Check for existing PRs first with `gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)"`, then use `gh pr edit` to update
- **No changes to PR**: Confirm with the user that work is committed

## Shaping the PR

**Default to ONE consolidated PR even when a task produces several independent changes.** Every PR boots the full workflow fan-out on a shared runner pool, so N small PRs cost ~N× the CI _and_ each one's required checks queue behind the others' long jobs. Land related and merely co-discovered work on one branch, one CI run, one review. Split only when a piece must land on its own timeline, or the consolidated diff would be too large to review coherently. One big PR still owes the reviewer legibility: one commit per separable concern, plus a `## Partitions` map in the body.

Use the `/pr-creation` skill. For contributions to others' repos, before writing a PR description, check for `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in the target repo and follow its conventions. **Never** include `claude.ai` URLs, session links, or AI-tool attribution links in PRs.

**A `## Lessons Learned` section is the exception, not the norm — most PRs should have none.** Each PR that carries one files an issue on the template repo (`phone-home` propagates it on merge), so the bar is high: include one **only** for a genuinely novel, non-obvious insight that generalizes to a downstream repo sharing none of this code and would change a template file (`.claude/`, `.hooks/`, `.github/workflows/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `setup.sh`). A repo-specific fix, a restatement of an existing rule, or an obvious CI tweak is triage noise — omit the section. When you do include one, each lesson must be actionable: **what** to change in the template, **where** (file/component), and **why**. **Never write a negative placeholder** ("none applicable", "N/A", "nothing generalizable") — phone-home drops those, so the sentence only churns; delete the heading entirely.

**Skip the `## Lessons Learned` section entirely when the repo this PR MERGES INTO is named `claude-automation-template`, whatever its owner.** `vars.TEMPLATE_SYNC_ORG` redirects a fork to its own template, so the owner is not fixed and the name is. phone-home runs in the base repo, so your checkout does not decide: from a fork, read the PR's base repo; otherwise `git remote get-url origin` answers it. Never take a repo's own `CLAUDE.md` prose as evidence: a repo made from the template often still carries the template's opening line. In the template a lesson propagates nothing, because the change is already there. Everywhere else phone-home is the only channel, and it runs one way into the template, so omitting the section drops the lesson for good.

**Lessons only reach the template repo if they appear in the PR description**—lessons mentioned only in chat are never propagated and are permanently lost.

**Resolving an addressed review thread is YOUR job — no workflow does it.** After each push, re-read the threads (`mcp__github__pull_request_read` method `get_review_comments`, or the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query) and resolve every one the push addressed, with `mcp__github__resolve_review_thread` on the thread's `PRRT_…` node id. Resolve **only** a thread you actually addressed — land the fix or post the reply first, never resolve to clear the count. Confirm each resolve took: a follow-up read shows `is_resolved: true`, because a stale thread id resolves nothing while the call still reports success.

Resolving a thread fires no event `review-gate.yaml` listens for, so the `Automated review posted` status stays stale until your next push re-runs it. The reviewer's own hold clears on the twice-hourly sweep (`claude-reviewer-hold-clear.yaml`) once no reviewer thread is unresolved. A hold whose concern lived only in the review BODY opens no thread to resolve — it clears when the reviewer re-reads your next push.
