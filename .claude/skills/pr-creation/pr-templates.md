# PR Templates and Formatting Reference

## Check for Repository PR Guidance

Before writing any PR description, check the repository for guidance on how to structure PRs:

1. Look for `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING`, or `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
2. Look for `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`
3. Look for `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` or `docs/contributing.md`

If any of these exist, **read them** and adapt your PR description to follow the repository’s conventions. Repository-specific guidance takes precedence over the default template below. Merge both: use the repo’s structure/sections but still include the Lessons Learned section from this template if applicable.

## PR Creation Command

First, check if a PR already exists for the current branch:

```bash
EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json number --jq '.[0].number' 2>/dev/null)
```

If `EXISTING_PR` is non-empty, update the existing PR with `gh pr edit` instead of creating a new one.

```bash
gh pr create --base "$CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF" --title "<type>: <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What & why
<FIRST sentence states what this PR does, in the imperative — the deliverable, not the
incident that motivated it. Then, only if it isn't obvious from the what, one or two
sentences of why. Length scales with the diff, not a fixed floor. Then each part's worked
example, per `CLAUDE.md` -> Writing.>

## Review focus
<!-- Non-trivial PRs only; delete for a small, self-evident diff. -->
<Where to look first and what you are least sure of — the one element most correlated with
a reviewer engaging. Name the security-/correctness-critical file to read first, the
cross-file invariant the diff can't show on one screen, and the part you'd most like
scrutinized ("the locking in `worker.ts:88`; the rest is a mechanical rename").>

## How it was tested
<What you ran and the outcome. Always this exact heading — never rename it to
"Tests"/"Verification"/"Testing"; one stable name lets a reviewer scan by habit.>

## Decisions made
<!-- Only if there are genuinely reviewer-owned judgments. Delete otherwise. -->
<Forks you resolved, costs you accepted, scope you cut — the highest-value-per-word content
for a reviewer, so don't bury it under boilerplate.>

## Lessons Learned
<!-- OMIT this whole section unless the PR produced a genuinely novel, cross-project insight. -->
<!-- Most PRs have none — that is the expected case. Do NOT write "none"/"N/A"/"nothing generalizable": phone-home drops such disclaimers, so a negative sentence is pure churn — just delete the heading. -->
<!-- Each lesson MUST specify: what to change, where, and why. Vague observations are not actionable. -->

- **What**: <concrete change — e.g., "Add X to CLAUDE.md", "Hook Y should also check Z">
- **Where**: <file or component — e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `session-setup.sh`, `phone-home.yaml`>
- **Why**: <1-2 sentences — what went wrong or was discovered>

## Title Format

Use imperative mood with a Conventional Commits type prefix:

- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `feat:` New features
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `docs:` Documentation
- `test:` Test changes
- `chore:` Maintenance

## Body Guidelines — write for the reviewer's cognitive budget

A PR description exists to transfer _understanding_ to a human overseer as cheaply as
possible, not to advertise the change or archive the investigation. Review is a
comprehension task before it is a defect-finding task (Bacchelli & Bird, ICSE 2013), and
for agent-authored PRs the documented failure mode is _under_-review driven by excessive
detail and trust-validation overhead — so the description must lower the activation energy
to engage, not raise it. Concretely:

- **Lead with the change, inverted-pyramid.** The first sentence states _what_ this PR does;
  the _why_ follows only if it isn't self-evident. Readers scan, weighting the first line and
  each line's start (F-pattern; Nielsen, inverted pyramid), so a lead that opens on
  root-cause forensics — run IDs, prior-PR chains, timelines — buries the one fact the
  reader needs. Push that archaeology below the fold or into a `<details>` block; never above
  the statement of what changed. Both "what" and "why" belong in the body — a diff already
  shows the what, so "why" alone is as incomplete as "what" alone — but the _lead_ is the what.
- **Length is proportional to the reviewable diff, not fixed.** A change of ~10 lines or fewer
  gets one to three sentences and no section headings at all; reserve the full skeleton for a
  diff big enough to need navigating. A flat ~500-word body on an 8-line change is pure
  extraneous load.
- **Omit empty ritual sections — never spend a paragraph to say "None."** If a change touches
  no security boundary, say nothing about security; a "Security boundary impact: None." section
  costs a read to learn there's nothing there. Don't spell the mechanical-attestation checklist
  (Conventional Commits / tests-not-weakened) out as visible body prose — it's enforced by hooks
  and CI and reads as noise; the GitHub template's collapsed "Author checklist" `<details>`
  already carries it, out of the reviewer's scan path.
- **Do the delocalized integration the reviewer's working memory can't.** The defects a reviewer
  misses are the cross-file ones (Baum et al., EMSE 2019); attention also decays down the file
  list (Fregnan et al., FSE 2022). So in "Review focus," name the interacting files, the
  invariant that spans them, and a reading order with the critical file first.
- **Partition a tangled diff _for_ the reviewer.** One logical concern per PR; tangled changes
  measurably hurt review accuracy (Herzig & Zeller, MSR 2013). When a refactor and a fix must
  ride together, label the partitions ("mechanical rename, files 1-7; behavior change, file 8")
  so each is reviewable on its own.
- **Match the diff's vocabulary.** Use the same identifiers and file paths in the prose as in
  the diff, and link claims to specific files/lines — that lexical "scent" is how a reviewer
  navigates to the code (information foraging).
- Note any breaking changes.
- **Default to NO “Lessons Learned” section.** It exists only for a genuinely novel, cross-project insight that would improve the template for a downstream repo sharing none of this code — a rare case; most PRs have none. Each lesson filed triggers the phone-home workflow (one issue per PR on the template repo), so a low-value or repo-specific “lesson” is triage noise, not a contribution. When you do include one, each lesson must specify **what** to change, **where**, and **why**. **Never write a negative placeholder** (“none applicable”, “N/A”, “nothing generalizable”): phone-home now drops those, so the sentence achieves nothing — omit the whole heading instead.
- **Skip the Lessons Learned section entirely when the repo this PR MERGES INTO is named `claude-automation-template`, whatever its owner** — `vars.TEMPLATE_SYNC_ORG` redirects a fork to its own template. phone-home runs in the base repo, so read that name — the PR's base repo from a fork, `git remote get-url origin` otherwise — and never the repo's own `CLAUDE.md` prose. Every other repo only sends and never receives, so dropping the section there loses the lesson.

## Updating PR Description After Additional Commits

Reuse the same skeleton as the create step (What & why / Review focus / How it was tested /
Decisions made / Lessons Learned), rewritten to describe the _current totality_ of the diff
— same inverted-pyramid lead and proportional length. Don't append a new "and then I also…"
paragraph on top of the old body; rewrite it so a reviewer arriving fresh reads one coherent
description, not an accretion log.

```bash
gh pr edit --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What & why
<Rewritten lead + why, covering all commits, with each part's worked example.>

## Review focus
<!-- Delete if the diff is small and self-evident. -->
<Reading order + least-certain part, updated for the current diff.>

## How it was tested
<What you ran and the outcome, updated.>

## Decisions made
<!-- Delete if none. -->
<Reviewer-owned judgments.>

## Lessons Learned
<!-- OMIT unless the PR produced a genuinely novel, cross-project insight (rare). Never write "none"/"N/A" — delete the heading. -->
