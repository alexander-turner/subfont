description: How to respond when a CI check goes red, a PR check fails, a test is flaky, or a job times out. Activate whenever a check is red or cancelled, a workflow run failed, a test is intermittent, you are about to claim a PR is green or mergeable, or you are about to re-run a job. The load-bearing rule is that a red check is a bug you have not diagnosed yet — "flake", "pre-existing", "unrelated", and "infra" are conclusions you must earn by reading the log, never opening assumptions, and never a licence to re-run. Also covers the one genuine exception (a red on a SHA a newer push superseded) and how to tell it apart from a real failure. Distinct from .github/CLAUDE.md, which owns how to AUTHOR a workflow rather than how to react to one.

# Responding to a red check

## Confirm the SHA first — but earn it

**A red check on a superseded commit is noise, not a defect.** Any newer push to
the branch (an autofix job that amends the head and force-pushes, a rebase, your
own follow-up commit) supersedes the prior SHA's in-flight runs, and GitHub
relays those cancelled/failed runs as red webhooks on the **old** SHA. Before
diagnosing, confirm the failure is on the branch's current head: a newer bot head
(e.g. one carrying a `Ci-autofix:` trailer) means the red belongs to a SHA that
no longer exists, and a `cancelled` conclusion from a superseding run is
supersession noise.

"Superseded" is **earned by reading the run and proving the head moved**, never
assumed to dodge a genuine failure. Every other red is a real bug caused by your
change until a read of the log proves otherwise.

## The doctrine

**A red check is a bug you have not diagnosed yet.** Treat every failure as real
and caused by the change in front of you until a read of the actual log proves
otherwise. These dismissals are **forbidden as opening assumptions** — never say
or act on any before you've read the failing log and proven the claim:
"infrastructure flake," "timeout," "unrelated," "pre-existing," "already broken
on the base branch," "passes on my machine," "only fails on another OS/platform,"
"load," "transient," "not what I was asked." Each is a _conclusion you must
earn_. "Flaky"/"external" is provable only by reading the log AND demonstrating
the root cause is non-deterministic and outside the repo; absent that proof it is
your bug. A timeout/download/racy failure is a real defect (a test too slow or
racy under parallelism, a missing retry/backoff), yours to fix at the root.

**"Flake" is NEVER a license to ignore, skip, mute, `xfail`, or merely re-run a
failure.** Proving something is a flake does not close it — it OBLIGATES a
root-cause fix (make the test deterministic, add the missing
retry/backoff/timeout budget, pin the unstable input) so it cannot recur. A flake
you leave in place is a red check you decided to tolerate, which is forbidden —
even when it is pre-existing and unrelated to your change (fix it in its own
`fix(test):`/`fix(ci):` commit; "it was already flaky" is not an exemption).

**Never just re-run a failure — root-cause it, then fix it.** A re-run is not a
resolution and is forbidden as the response to a red check, even for a failure
you've proven external (a third-party runtime crash, a hosted-runner fault, a
vendored-binary bug). The sequence on any failure: (1) read the actual failing log
and **diagnose to root cause** — the specific mechanism, not a category label;
(2) implement the fix at that root cause and drive it green — a resilience/retry
guard in our own code that would have survived the fault, a portability fix, a
race fix, or (when the defect is genuinely upstream) a hardening of _our_
interaction with it plus a written upstream report. A re-run is permitted only as
a one-time unblock riding alongside an already-in-flight root-cause fix — never
instead of it, never the plan. If you can't yet name the mechanism, keep digging.

**Fix it in this PR.** "Pre-existing," "I didn't break it," and "out of scope" are
not exemptions — a failure you can see is yours to fix. If it's genuinely
unrelated, fix it in its own commit (`fix(test):`/`fix(ci):`) on this branch, not
a future one.

**Reproduce, then fix at the root — do not guess.** Before touching anything,
reproduce the failure (same parallelism, same OS marker, same inputs); never
"fix" by guessing at "load" or "flake." Prefer the root cause (or the tool's own
config) over a local suppression; reach for an inline `disable`/`ignore` only for
a genuine false positive, justified in a comment naming why.

**An OS/platform-specific failure is the highest-value signal, not an excuse.**
"Green on Linux, red on macOS" (or vice-versa) means you found a real GNU/BSD
divergence — reason about it from first principles (coreutils flag differences,
`mkdir -p`/`ln`/`stat`/`readlink` behavior, symlink semantics) and fix the
portability bug. Never wave it off as the other platform's problem.

## Don't iterate on a slow or paid run

**A slow/paid CI run is a last-resort verifier, never an iteration loop —
reproduce the failing layer locally FIRST.** When a fix targets something a long,
expensive, or live-fire workflow exercises, do not verify by dispatching it and
waiting turn after turn. Reproduce that layer locally and iterate there until it's
green, then let CI confirm once. Two traps make "dispatched and waiting" a false
signal: a faked-input unit test can enshrine a wrong assumption the real
dependency would refute, and a run tied to a branch/PR is **cancelled on merge**
so it may never reach the assertion. Let the PR-head run finish before the merge
when the confirmation is meant to gate it — a post-merge run cannot block what
already landed. Dispatch against the **default branch** only for a confirmation
that must outlive the PR, and name its reader first: a run with no PR
association is never cancelled, and has no PR surface either, so either watch it
to completion or check the workflow reaches `ci-failure-notify.yaml`.

## Before claiming green

Read the aggregate, not one page of check runs. On a repo with many checks, a
single page is a truncated slice and a failing check may sit on a page you never
read. The PR's `mergeable_state` (`clean` = no failing required checks and up to
date; `blocked`/`dirty`/`behind` = not mergeable) is the source of truth.

## Handing off is the last resort, and only after the work

The only acceptable hand-off is a failure you've already diagnosed to root cause
AND cannot resolve from inside the session (it needs a maintainer to re-run a job
your token can't trigger, or an environment-side change). Even then: state the
proven root cause, what you tried, and exactly what's blocking — never declare
green, never imply the red doesn't count, never go silent.
