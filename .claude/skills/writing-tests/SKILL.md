description: How to write, change, or review tests — the load-bearing rule is test real behavior, not source text. Also covers non-vacuity (prove the test can fail), e2e tests that secretly stub the component they name, drift guards as a design smell to name rather than launder, SSOT contract tests that must move with their data, stubs that must drain stdin, checks that must prove the subject ran before judging its output, probes that must not perturb the state they read, failure-signature lists that must carve out your own guards' refusals, and the Python test idioms (repo-root discovery, `exec()`-ing a module's `__main__`, `from __future__ import annotations`) that bite under pytest-xdist. Activate whenever the user asks to write, add, fix, refactor, strengthen, or review tests ("write a test", "add tests", "test this", "regression test", "cover this", "why didn't this test catch it"), or when a coding task's last step is testing the change you just made.

# Writing tests

## Test behavior, not source text

**Never grep the implementation as a proxy for what it does.** Asserting that a
file contains a string, a flag, or a call name passes just as happily when the
code around it is broken, and it locks the test to a spelling rather than a
behavior. Drive the real code path under stubs and assert the observable
outcome: the installed file and its mode, the exec argv and environment, the
exit code, the bytes emitted.

**Assert the operation, not a keyword.** `assert "chown -R root:root" in content`
is a source-text check wearing a behavior badge; run the thing and assert the
resulting ownership.

## Prove the test can fail (non-vacuity)

A test that passes against the unfixed code tests nothing. For every regression
test, run it against the code as it was before the fix and show it red, then
green after. When that is awkward, invert the branch the fix added and confirm a
test goes red.

**A fix's own comment is the spec its test must be driven from.** Treat any
generality claim in a fix's comment ("matched on the phrase, not the exact
wording", "handles any of these retryable phrasings") as the behavior under test,
and drive cases from that claim rather than the single input that first triggered
the bug. "Comment promises more generality than the test exercises" is the
cheapest reviewer tell for a hollow regression test.

## An accusation needs evidence from the subject, never an absence

**A check that concludes from a missing artifact reads a dead environment as a violation.** An absent log, an unreadable output file, a process that exited before it wrote anything — each is evidence-shaped and proves nothing. Assert that the subject ran and produced the artifact, then judge what the artifact says. A check that skips the first step goes red loudest exactly when its own harness broke. It is the twin of the vacuous green: one missing input, reported as a false accusation instead of a false pass.

**Read the subject's state before its output, and read it without touching it.** Ask the runtime's own inventory — `docker ps -a`, a job list, a status endpoint — rather than entering the thing. Entering a stopped container starts it, so the probe destroys the ending it exists to observe.

**Exclude your own guards' words from any failure-signature list.** A defense usually refuses in the operating system's wording, so `Permission denied` from a root-owned file is the guard working. A crash-signature or error-string match that does not carve those out scores a correct refusal as a failure.

## Never skip or weaken a test unless asked

Including silently dropping an assertion while refactoring, and including
loosening one to make a finding "go away". If a test is wrong, fix what it
asserts and say so; don't quietly reduce what it proves.

## An e2e test that stubs its own subject is a unit test wearing a badge

**An e2e test that monkeypatches or re-implements the component it names can pass
while the real boundary is broken.** For each "end-to-end" test, ask: is the named
component actually executed, or stubbed? Drive the real component and assert an
observed side effect; reserve stubs for genuine external dependencies. Where a
real substitution can't run, pin the duplicated contract with a drift guard —
and name it as one (below).

## Drift guards are a smell to NAME, not launder

A test that asserts two duplicated sources agree — a hand-maintained copy (a
literal list, an example map, a mirrored constant) that must match a separate
config/file/other-language copy — means you don't have an SSOT. The honest moves
are exactly two:

1. **Kill the duplication** — make one source authoritative, or generate the
   second copy at build time so it can't drift. When consumers share a language,
   check first whether one already reads the other at runtime; if so, hoist the
   value to a single sourced file and delete the guard.
2. **Keep the guard and mark it in the open** — only when a true single source is
   genuinely infeasible (a hard cross-language/cross-process boundary, an external
   value you don't control): mark it
   `@pytest.mark.drift_guard("<why a true SSOT is infeasible>")`, naming the
   concrete boundary.

**The banned move is relabeling the guard to dodge that** — calling a
copies-agree test an "SSOT contract" / "coverage contract" / "portability check"
so it reads as principled rather than duplicated. The tell you're laundering: the
framing makes _duplication-with-a-guard_ sound like _duplication eliminated_
("pinned to the SSOT" when nothing was unified). This binds regardless of language
and regardless of whether a lint fires — "the check didn't catch it" is not a
defense; widen the check.

## Contracts move with their data

- **SSOT contract tests must change in the same commit as their data.** When a
  deny/allow list, generated file, or doc has a round-trip test ("cases exactly
  cover the live config" / "committed output == regenerated output"), editing the
  source without updating the test is a silent CI break. Search for such a
  contract test before landing any change to the data it guards.
- **Config-derived ordered lists: derive the test's expected order from the same
  config file.** Reordering entries in the config silently breaks any test with a
  hardcoded copy of the order.
- **When a fix repoints a dangling reference, add a repo-wide static scan for the
  whole class.** After fixing a "referenced X was deleted" bug (file path, image
  tag, service name, config key, workflow filename), add a scan driven on
  `git ls-files` output that asserts every referenced X of that kind still
  resolves. These bugs hide on opt-in/cost-gated paths that no functional test
  exercises; a cheap static contract catches the entire class at once.

## Stubs

- **Don't write a stub. Drive the real thing.** A stub encodes your reading of a dependency; the real dependency encodes its own — and the two drift the moment the real tool changes a flag, an exit code, or an error format. The stub then silently greens invocations the real tool would reject. Use the real binary against a fixture directory, a recorded interaction, or a container image pinned in CI. **A stub is licensed only when the real thing genuinely cannot run in the test** (a paid API, hardware, a wall-clock boundary you cannot fake) — and the stub definition site says which of those applies. "Faster to write" is not a reason.
- **When a stub is licensed, it must reject what the real tool rejects and consume what it consumes.** A stub that accepts every flag pair certifies only your reading of the interface; one that exits without draining stdin under `set -o pipefail` causes the writer's `write()` to get EPIPE (rc 141) intermittently, independent of pipe-buffer size. Reproduce the argv/stdin/env behavior the caller depends on, and add `cat >/dev/null` in the body when it stands in for a pipe consumer.

## Python test idioms

- Resolve the repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, not
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` — depth-based parent-walking silently
  breaks when test files are moved.
- Don't add `from __future__ import annotations` unless you need runtime
  annotation introspection (`typing.get_type_hints()`, Pydantic) — `dict[str, str]`
  and `X | None` work natively in Python 3.9+.
- **Running a module's `__main__` via `exec()` executes real startup side
  effects**, including direct `os.environ[...]` mutations that `monkeypatch` never
  recorded and therefore never restores. Under `pytest-xdist` those mutations leak
  to later tests on the same worker. Snapshot and restore the environment around
  such `exec()` calls, or pre-register every mutated key with `monkeypatch` first.
- Parametrize for compactness; prefer exact-equality assertions over
  `in`/truthiness, which pass for the wrong reason.
