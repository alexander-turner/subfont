## How It Works

### Session Start Hook

When Claude Code starts a session, it automatically runs `session-setup.sh` which:

1. **Installs tools**: shfmt, gh (GitHub CLI), jq, shellcheck
2. **Configures git hooks**: Sets `core.hooksPath` to `.hooks/`
3. **Validates GitHub CLI auth**: Fails fast if `GH_TOKEN` is missing
4. **Detects GitHub repo**: Extracts `owner/repo` from proxy remotes in web sessions
5. **Installs dependencies**: Node (pnpm/npm) and Python (uv) if applicable

### Pre-Push Check Hook

Before `git push` or `gh pr` commands, `pre-push-check.sh` runs any configured checks:

- **build** (`pnpm build`): Catches type errors in TypeScript projects
- **lint** (`pnpm lint`): Catches code quality issues
- **typecheck** (`pnpm check`): Additional type checking if configured
- **ruff**: Python linting if applicable

Only runs scripts that are actually configured in `package.json`—skips placeholder scripts.

### PostToolUse Hook

After each tool call, `parallelism-nudge.mjs` measures from the session transcript whether the current user-turn is actually using parallel execution—sub-agent delegation (`Task`/`Agent`/`Workflow`) or same-message tool-call batches—and splices in a one-time nudge carrying the concrete counts when a long fully-serial streak is detected. It is the deterministic enforcement arm of CLAUDE.md's parallelism rule.

**Posture: advisory.** It never blocks (`additionalContext` only), fails open on any internal error, and nudges at most once per user-turn segment, so a long turn is not re-narrated on every call.

`bullshit-check.mjs` also runs here, and on `UserPromptSubmit`. Once per twelve-minute window, at a moment hashed from the session id, it drops one short self-audit question into the agent's context: the evidence check ("name the command whose output backs the claim you are about to make"), "are you taking the principled solution?", or "is any of this unnecessary?", which asks what the work can delete before it is called done. Both events already run the agent, so an idle session is never woken; a window missed while idle is carried to the next tool call, never to a prompt, so the question lands after work exists to audit. State lives under `$TMPDIR/claude-bullshit-check/` (`BULLSHIT_CHECK_STATE_DIR` overrides it).

**Posture: advisory.** `additionalContext` only, one question per window across both events, and every fault exits silently.

### UserPromptSubmit Hook

`drop-superseded-ci-events.mjs` drops non-actionable PR webhook turns before the model runs. A session subscribed to a PR is woken for every check run and bot comment; two classes carry nothing to act on—a CI-failure event whose head SHA a newer push already superseded, and a `github-actions[bot]` alert carrying the `[ignore-notif]` opt-out marker. The bot-author check reads only the trusted header preceding the first `<untrusted_external_data>` tag, so a forged author line inside an untrusted comment body cannot drive suppression.

**Posture: fail open.** It is a noise filter, not a defense—any uncertainty passes the turn through untouched.

`bullshit-check.mjs` runs on this event too; see the PostToolUse section above.

### Stop Hook

`completion-check.mjs` asks once, after the session has pushed, whether ALL the requested work is finished, and blocks the stop until the agent answers `Yes.` as its last line or `**Resuming work**` as its first. The push is recorded on `PreToolUse` under the same `Bash(git push:*)` matcher `pre-push-check.sh` uses, so no shell text is parsed. The check arms at a moment drawn from the five minutes after the first push, or at one of the first three stops that did real work, and a session that never pushes is never asked.

**Posture: blocking, bounded, fail open.** It asks at most three times (`COMPLETION_CHECK_MAX`, a positive integer), then allows the stop; a turn with nothing to certify is allowed without spending the one shot; a malformed event or an unwritable state directory allows the stop; and `COMPLETION_CHECK=0` disables it. State lives under `$TMPDIR/claude-completion-check/` (`COMPLETION_CHECK_STATE_DIR` overrides it).

### Skills

Skills in `skills/` are reusable workflows that guide Claude through complex tasks:

- **pr-creation**: Creating pull requests with mandatory self-critique before submission (invoke with `/pr-creation`)
- **update-pr**: Updating an existing PR with new changes and an optionally revised description (`/update-pr`)
- **peer-review**: Running the read-only `code-reviewer` subagent on the diff, then triaging and fixing findings (`/peer-review`)
- **explore-plan**: Enforcing the Explore → Plan → Critique → Review → Verify discipline for non-trivial work (`/explore-plan`)
- **ci-triage**: Responding to a red or cancelled check by diagnosing its log—"flake", "pre-existing", and "unrelated" are conclusions to earn, never opening assumptions (`/ci-triage`)
- **writing-tests**: Writing, changing, or reviewing tests, on the load-bearing rule that tests assert behavior, not source text (`/writing-tests`)
- **conventional-commits**: Guiding Conventional Commits with secret detection—invoke with `/commit` (the skill's `name` is `commit`)
- **markdown-block**: Emitting copyable raw markdown in a fenced code block (`/markdown-block`)

The `agents/` directory holds subagents—currently `code-reviewer`, a read-only (Read/Grep/Glob) reviewer used by the `peer-review` skill for an unbiased second opinion on a diff.

Skills are automatically available to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Customization

### Adding Tools

Edit `hooks/session-setup.sh` to add more tools:

```bash
# Via uv
uv_install_if_missing mycommand mypackage

# Via webi (https://webinstall.dev) — pin versions for supply-chain safety
webi_install_if_missing mytool mytool@1

# Via apt (requires root)
if is_root; then
  apt-get install -y mytool
fi
```

### Adding Skills

Create new skill directories in `skills/` following the pattern in `pr-creation/SKILL.md`. Each skill should be a directory with a `SKILL.md` entrypoint and optional supporting files.

### Customizing Hooks

Modify `settings.json` to add more hooks. See the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for available hook types.

**Always wrap PreToolUse hooks with `safe-launch.sh`.** A PreToolUse hook that fails to parse (e.g. unresolved merge conflict markers) exits non-zero, which Claude Code treats as a block—locking the session out of repairing the very file that’s broken. `safe-launch.sh` detects the parse failure and degrades open: edits under `.claude/hooks/` and `.hooks/` are allowed for self-repair; all other tools get `permissionDecision: "ask"`.

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/safe-launch.sh \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/your-new-hook.sh"
}
```

Any script under `.claude/hooks/` or `.hooks/` is also syntax-checked at session start by `session-setup.sh`—broken hooks surface as loud warnings before they can block the first tool call.
