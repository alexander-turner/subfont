# Prompt authoring

Every file this rule loads for is a prompt: a session reads it and acts on it. Root `CLAUDE.md` owns the compactness rule and the plain-imperative rule. These bind on top of it, and each one comes from [Anthropic's prompting guidance for Opus 5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5), the model this repo runs.

- **Write no self-check instructions that ask the model to re-examine its own reasoning.** Delete "double-check your answer", "re-verify before responding", "add a step that re-confirms your own conclusion". Opus 5 [already checks its own work](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#task-scope-and-over-verification), so the instruction compounds with the behavior and buys tokens, not quality. **This never touches an EXECUTABLE verification step** — running a test, hitting an endpoint, reading real command output — which produces evidence a self-check instruction cannot, and whose output someone reads: `explore-plan`'s Verify step and `pr-creation`'s validation runs name their commands in the report, and so does a claim's CHECKER (per root `CLAUDE.md`'s Supervision-legible work) — a check whose result only the session ever sees does not earn this exemption just because it ran a command. **Nor does it touch a genuinely independent reviewer** — `peer-review`'s and `pr-creation`'s critique loop launch a separate, unbiased-by-implementation sub-agent, the opposite of an agent re-checking its own prior output. **Nor the bounded critique pass this repo already runs** — root `CLAUDE.md`'s Self-Critique Loop and `explore-plan`'s Critique step read the ARTIFACT (a diff, a plan draft) to a fixed point under a stated cap, which is a fresh hostile read, not a re-affirmation. The test: does this step produce new evidence someone reads (a test result, a fresh unbiased read, a hostile read of the artifact) or does it just ask the same reasoning to look at itself again?
- **A rule the session must obey under execution momentum belongs on the tool-use loop, not in the prose you are writing.** Prose competes with whatever the session is already part-way through doing, and loses. When the behaviour has to hold, write a `PreToolUse` hook that denies the raw call and names the sanctioned path in its reason; [`hooks.md`](hooks.md) owns how to build one and what such a hook can promise.
- **Damp delegation in any prompt that can spawn.** Say which work earns a sub-agent, and give a number where you can. Opus 5 delegates more readily than earlier models, so a prompt that only says "use sub-agents for parallel work" produces a fleet on work one grep answers.
- **State the scope the task holds.** Opus 5 widens a narrow task on its own judgement. A prompt for a bounded job says so: deliver what was asked, make routine calls yourself, and say it in a sentence instead of quietly widening the work.
- **Pair every ban list with one worked example of the wanted behavior.** [A positive example steers better than a prohibition](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#user-facing-progress-updates), and a list of banned phrasings without one leaves the reader guessing at the shape that passes.
- **Put a long input at the TOP of a prompt and the instruction at the END.** A document, a diff or a log above the question reads better than the same text below it, [by up to 30 percent in Anthropic's tests](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#long-context-prompting). Wrap each input in its own tag so the reader can tell input from instruction.
- **Give every summary, report or status comment a word budget**, and say what belongs elsewhere. Root `CLAUDE.md`'s Writing section carries this for `.github/prompts/`; it holds for a skill's report step too.
