# Resolve the conflict markers template-sync.sh wrote, in the sync run itself,
# so the sync PR arrives ready to read instead of carrying raw markers and a
# request for someone else to clean up later.
#
# This is a DRIVER, not a second resolver. Tier 2 is the resolver's own
# auto-resolve/fanout.py — the same per-block bounded model runs the
# merge-conflict resolver uses. A sync conflict is a marker-bearing file, which
# is exactly fanout's input, so nothing here re-implements resolution.
#
# Two tiers, cheapest first:
#   1. STRUCTURAL — mergiraf re-merges from the markers, syntax-aware. Free, and
#      the result is reproducible from the inputs by anyone.
#   2. MODEL — fanout resolves whatever is left, one bounded run per file.
#
# Which tier resolved which file is the output that matters, because the
# workflow's auto-merge predicate only accepts a sync whose every resolution was
# deterministic. A model resolution is exactly the class the merge-delta reviewer
# exists to catch, so it must not also be the class that merges unattended.
#
# Env:
#   CONFLICT_FILES           whitespace-separated marker-bearing paths (required)
#   PR_NUMBER                the sync PR, for fanout's per-file prompt (required)
#   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN  when unset, tier 2 is skipped and its files are
#                            reported unresolved — the fallback to today's
#                            behavior, where a human resolves the markers
#   MERGIRAF_BIN             test override for the structural tier
