"""Render a markdown report of every hand-authored merge-resolution delta in a
PR's commit range, for supervision review.

A merge commit's tree is authored freely — nothing forces it to equal the
mechanical 3-way merge of its parents, so a conflict resolution can smuggle in
a change present in NEITHER parent (an "evil merge") that a normal one-parent
diff never shows. `git show --remerge-diff` reconstructs the mechanical merge
and diffs the recorded tree against it, isolating exactly what the resolver
typed. This script runs that over every merge commit in BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA and
prints one markdown section per merge whose resolution still needs a human;
prints nothing when there is nothing hand-authored left to review.

"Still needs a human" is the whole job, because the raw delta over-reports
badly. Three filters retire a file or a hunk, each answering a question the
downstream reviewer cannot answer for itself:

  * SUPERSEDED — the file's bytes at head now equal the mechanical merge's or a
    parent's, so a later commit replaced the resolution's delta with reference
    bytes and nothing hand-authored ships.
  * TRACED — every block the hunk touches is already one parent's own edit
    against the parents' merge-base. That is the ordinary conflict resolution.
  * UNDONE — every trace of the hunk is gone from the file at head, so a
    follow-up commit corrected it.

What survives is a delta no parent's intent explains and no later commit undid.
The report also carries a per-file PROVENANCE block, because the downstream
reviewer has no shell and cannot read the parents itself: without it, a line a
branch removed deliberately and a line the resolver dropped look identical as a
`-`.

Env: BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA (required). REMERGE_REPORT_MAX_BYTES caps the body;
UNSET MEANS NO CAP. Only the PR-comment renderer sets it, because only GitHub
imposes a size limit — the readers that actually audit have none, and a merge
dropped from what they read is a merge nobody looks at, on the one channel an
evil merge can hide in.

`--commit SHA` reports that one merge, uncapped, and reads no environment: it
serves a caller judging a resolution it just built. Head is that same commit
there, so nothing is superseded and no hunk is undone — the only correct answer
for a resolution that has not been pushed yet.

`--shas-out FILE` writes the merge SHAs the report covered, one per line, so a
consumer can key state on which merges a review actually read rather than
re-parsing the markdown.

Fails loud (SystemExit) on a merge with more than two parents: --remerge-diff
cannot reconstruct an octopus merge, and silently skipping one would report
"nothing to review" about exactly the kind of commit that needs review.
