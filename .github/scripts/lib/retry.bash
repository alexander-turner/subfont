# retry_cmd MAX INITIAL_DELAY COMMAND...
# Retries COMMAND up to MAX (>= 1) times; sleeps INITIAL_DELAY seconds before the second
# attempt, doubling each time. Prints a one-line progress note to stderr before
# each retry. Returns 0 on the first success, 1 after all MAX attempts fail; the
# caller is responsible for the final error message and any fallback.
# MAX and INITIAL_DELAY must be integers: the backoff doubles the delay with
# integer arithmetic (`$(( ))`), so a non-integer (e.g. 0.5) is a syntax error
# that aborts a set -e caller — reject it loudly at entry instead.
