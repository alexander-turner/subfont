# anthropic-ladder.bash — one /v1/messages call, walked across an ordered
# credential ladder.
#
# The tempting alternative — picking the credential with a GitHub expression
# `${{ secrets.A || secrets.B || secrets.C }}` — is not a ladder. `||` picks
# the first NON-EMPTY value at expression time, so a credential that is present
# but expired, revoked, or over its cap is never fallen back from — the later
# secrets are dead weight, reachable only by unsetting the first one, and one
# expired subscription token takes down every direct-API caller while live
# credentials sit configured beside it.
#
# Here the fallback is a runtime decision on the API's own answer. A rung is
# abandoned when the API's verdict is about the CREDENTIAL: an HTTP 401/403
# outright, or a 429 that survives the rung's own retries — a token over its own
# quota, which is how a live subscription credential most often stops answering.
# Everything else keeps its existing meaning: 408/5xx and transport failures
# retry on the SAME credential (transient, and no evidence about the token), and
# any other 4xx fails the run immediately (the request itself is malformed, so
# every rung would reject it identically). Exhausting the ladder fails loud.
# Walking it therefore only changes WHO answers, never WHAT the answer is.
#
# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set
# shell options. Requires .github/scripts/lib/retry.bash to be sourced first.

# The ladder, in attempt order: the subscription tokens the Claude workflows
# use, and nothing else. Each draws on a flat-rate plan, so no run these
# callers make can bill per-token credits. Exhausting the ladder fails loud,
# and that is the intended end — a metered charge is not an acceptable
# fallback.
