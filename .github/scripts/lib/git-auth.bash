# THE ONE PLACE THAT BUILDS A github.com GIT AUTH HEADER. Every CI script here checks out with
# persist-credentials:false — the checkout must not carry main-push credentials — so each one
# has to re-authenticate its own remote calls. The correct shape is an `http.<url>.extraheader`
# carrying `AUTHORIZATION: basic base64(x-access-token:TOKEN)`, never a token in the remote
# URL's userinfo: `git clone`/`git remote set-url` writes that URL verbatim into the clone's
# on-disk .git/config, outliving the process that minted the token
# (tests/test_no_credential_in_url.py guards the class).
#
# git_auth_header TOKEN applies it to EVERY git call this process makes afterwards, for a
# script whose remote calls are many and all github.com (fetch, ls-remote, push).
#
# It spells the config key ONCE, here, and RESETS it. A hand-written key rides to any host
# git talks to the moment someone writes the unscoped `http.extraheader`, and a hand-written
# `git -c` defends nothing against the environment: `-c` ADDS to GIT_CONFIG_*, it does not
# displace it, so an inherited header still resolves beside it and an inherited transport
# override still reroutes the request.

# Guard against double-source (a script that sources this AND a lib that also does). This
# file is only ever sourced, so a top-level `return` is well-defined.
