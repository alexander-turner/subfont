# Path-gate matching that cannot read a tool failure as "nothing matched".
# Sourced, never executed.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a required check goes green having scanned nothing. A gate asks
# grep whether any changed file matches its regex, and skips the expensive job
# when the answer is no. grep exits 1 for "no match" but 2 for a failure of its
# own: a malformed regex, an unreadable input. The three idioms that read that
# answer — `if grep -q …`, `grep -q … || true`, and `grep -q … && echo true ||
# echo false` — all collapse 2 into "no". The job then skips, its always()
# reporter greens the skip, and nothing looked at the diff.
#
# Both helpers fail OPEN on every status except a clean 1: a wasted run is
# safe, a silently skipped gate is not. They fail open rather than abort because one
# decide job computes many verdicts, and a hard exit there blocks every gate it
# feeds instead of just over-running one.

# path_gate_matching_lines REGEX TEXT — the matching lines of TEXT on stdout, or
# ALL of TEXT when grep failed, so a caller that narrows the match further (a
# comment-only diff test) sees the widest set rather than none. A clean no-match
# prints nothing. Always returns 0, so a caller under `set -e` gates on the
# output being non-empty.
path_gate_matching_lines() {
  local rc=0 out=""
  out=$(grep -E "$1" <<<"$2") || rc=$?
  if ((rc > 1)); then
    out="$2"
  fi
  if [[ -n "$out" ]]; then
    printf '%s\n' "$out"
  fi
  return 0
}

# path_gate_matching_members LIST TEXT — the lines of TEXT that are exact members
# of the newline-separated LIST, or ALL of TEXT when grep failed or LIST is empty.
# A clean no-match prints nothing. Always returns 0, like the helper above.
#
# The empty LIST is its own arm because a derivation that produced nothing is a
# derivation that failed: reading it as "no member changed" is the silent skip
# this file exists to prevent.
