# PROBLEM CLASS: `gh api POST .../reviews` can 422 on APPROVE (and occasionally
# REQUEST_CHANGES) under GITHUB_TOKEN when the repo does not allow Actions to
# cast a formal vote — observed in both the reviewer's poster and
# auto-approve-skipped-pr.sh — while COMMENT always succeeds. Any script in
# this repo that posts a PR review via the reviews API must retry a rejected
# event as COMMENT before giving up, since review-gate.sh's "Automated review
# posted" check counts any undismissed review regardless of event.
#
# post_review_with_retry <pr> <payload_json_path> <fallback_comment_path>
# payload_json_path is a JSON object with at least {event, body}, ready for
# `gh api --input`. fallback_comment_path is posted as a plain PR comment only
# if both the original event and the COMMENT retry are rejected.
