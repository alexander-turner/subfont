# Exit 0 iff every added/removed line in `git diff BASE_SHA...HEAD_SHA -- <files>`
# is blank or a comment for that file's language; exit 1 the moment a substantive
# line appears (or a file has no comment syntax and changed at all). Lets an
# ADVISORY decide-gated workflow (decide-reusable-diff.sh) treat a path match that
# is pure comment/doc churn as "nothing relevant changed" and skip its expensive
# sampling.
#
# SAFE DIRECTION, load-bearing: a real code line never begins with a comment marker, so a
# substantive change is never misclassified as comment-only — the only misread is
# comment→substantive, which merely over-runs the (advisory) workflow. Inline comments
# (`code  # note`) count as substantive, because the whole line is a code line. A shebang
# is the one code line that opens with a comment marker, so the loop below treats a changed
# `#!` line as substantive whatever the file's marker. This one-way safety is why a caller
# may trust the verdict even though the marker table is a heuristic, not a parser.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — deciding whether a diff's changed lines are substantive, or only
# comments and blank lines. Read the one-way safety argument above before adding a
# caller: it is what lets a consumer trust a marker table instead of a parser, and it
# is the reason no caller needs its own scanner.
#
# Env: BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA (the PR's merge-base range endpoints).
# Args: the files to inspect (already filtered to the workflow's paths-regex).

# lines: `* ` (space after), a lone `*`, or `*/`. It deliberately does NOT match a
# `*` glued to an identifier (`*gen() {`, a generator method), so real code that
# happens to start with `*` never reads as a comment — preserving the one-way safety
