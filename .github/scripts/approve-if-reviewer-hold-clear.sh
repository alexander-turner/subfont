# Approve the PR when the automated reviewer's hold is fully cleared, regardless
# of WHO cleared the last thread. This is the single source of truth for "the
# reviewer requested changes (or commented), every one of its threads is now
# resolved, so post the APPROVE that supersedes the hold and satisfies a
# review-required ruleset."
#
# It is deliberately state-based and idempotent: it reads the CURRENT thread and
# review state via the API and decides from that alone, never from who resolved
# what. That is what closes the stranding gap — the approval used to fire only as
# a side effect of the resolver resolving the last thread itself, so a thread
# resolved any other way (a human clicking Resolve, an agent, a prior run's race)
# left the CHANGES_REQUESTED with nothing to clear it. Runs on a periodic sweep
# of open PRs (claude-reviewer-hold-clear.yaml), so a thread an agent or a human
# resolves — which fires no workflow event — cannot leave the hold stranded.
#
# Approves ONLY when the reviewer's LATEST review is a live hold or comment —
# CHANGES_REQUESTED or COMMENTED (any other latest state means nothing to clear:
# APPROVED already through, DISMISSED, or "" the reviewer never reviewed this PR —
# so an unrelated thread-resolved event mints no approval; this allowlist is
# stricter than "!= APPROVED" on purpose) — AND one of two resolution signals holds:
#   the reviewer opened at least one thread (root comment authored by
#   REVIEWER_LOGIN) and none is still unresolved. A hold whose concern lived only
#   in the review body opens no thread, so it clears on the reviewer's own
#   re-review instead.
