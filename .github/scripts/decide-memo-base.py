"""Print the newest commit on this branch at which a gate's work job actually PASSED.

PROBLEM CLASS — a path gate re-running work it already proved. A decide job diffs
the pull request's whole `base…head` range, so one touch of a watched path makes
every later push on that branch run the expensive job again, whatever the later
commits contain. A branch that touches a watched path once and then pushes ten
docs-only commits pays for the expensive job eleven times. The same waste arrives
with no new commit at all: a `ready_for_review` re-fire carries the SAME head SHA
as the draft run, so the whole range is diffed twice.

The fix is to move the diff base forward: diff from the last commit this workflow
VERIFIED rather than from the branch point. This module answers "which commit was
that", and prints nothing when it cannot answer — the caller then keeps today's
base, so every unknown costs a re-run and never a skip.

SOUNDNESS. A green check must mean the tree it names passes, so the anchor has to
be a tree the work actually ran on:

  * the anchor's work job must have CONCLUDED SUCCESS, never `skipped`. A skipped
    job's green was inherited from an earlier anchor, so anchoring on it would let
    the deltas between them go unwatched. Anchoring only on an executed success
    keeps the induction sound: the run that skipped kept the older anchor, so its
    own delta is still inside the next diff.
  * a FAILED run never becomes an anchor, so the delta that broke the job stays in
    every later diff until a run executes it and passes.
  * only a COMPLETED success is listed, so the current run is never its own
    candidate. That filter is what makes a run at the SAME head safe to anchor on.
  * the anchor must be an ANCESTOR of the head being tested, or the diff between
    them is not a subset of the branch's own history (a force-push rewrites it).
  * the anchor EXPIRES. A memoized pass also caches the world the job ran against
    — a registry, a base image, a pinned toolchain — so an old anchor claims more
    than it verified.

Every one of those checks falls back to "no anchor" rather than raising, and each
prints its reason to stderr: the caller must be able to see WHY a run re-ran.

Stdlib only, and no third-party client — the decide job runs on a bare runner with
no virtualenv. It shells out to `gh api` and `git`, both present there.

Usage: decide-memo-base.py
Env: GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GH_TOKEN, WORKFLOW_REF, HEAD_BRANCH, HEAD_SHA,
