# real session hits them: session setup -> pre-commit -> pre-push checks.
#
# This catches hooks that break end-to-end (a syntax error, a missing tool, a
# formatter that errors on the repo's own files) before they reach a session
# and silently block every tool call. Run by `.github/workflows/hook-lifecycle.yaml`.
